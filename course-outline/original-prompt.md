# Intro to Postgres Course - Original Request

## Source
[Intro to Postgres Course](https://databaseschool.com/series/intro-to-postgres/)

## Context
User is learning Postgres basics using Supabase's managed Postgres instance. They want to practice concepts from the course with challenging exercises.

## Original Request
Take a look at the Intro to Postgres course I'm doing now. I'm learning the basics behind Postgres and how to use it. I'm using Supabase's managed Postgres instance to learn and work along the course. So far, the course's been good, but now I want to practice the concepts I've learned so far.

### Task to execute:
- Propose exercises for each main concept in the course. The exercises must make me actively use the concept learned to solve it in a successful way. The exercises should also be challenging.
- For each section there should be one project where all the concepts I've seen so far must be applied. The project should be challenging and should require me to deeply know the logic behind the concepts I've learned.

### Structure to follow:
- For each section, topic and project you should create a folder.
- Both the exercise statements and the project briefs should be in markdown files.

### Guidance for writing the exercise statements and project briefs:
- The exercise statements should be like problem sets. They should require a deep understanding of the topic in order to solve it.
- The projects are accumulative; the should encompass all the topics seen so far if they are relevant to the topic / section at hand.
    - The projects should also be challenging. I don't need to replicate basic examples, but understand the concept deeply to solve any related problem.
- Both exercise statements and project briefs should be very detailed in their requirements. They should explain in detail what they need and the concepts needed to solve the exercise / project.
- Write an additional file called hints.md for each exercise / project brief. The idea behind it is to provide a very general step by step on how to solve the exercise / project and give some hints that will allow me to keep going if I get stuck at some point. DO NOT INCLUDE PLAIN SOLUTIONS. Just hints / questions that can take me to the answer if I think deeply about them.
